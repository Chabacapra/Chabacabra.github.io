    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
    <p class="text"><i>Skirnismál</i> is an Old Norse poem, and a piece of the Poetic Edda. The poem opens describing how Freyr, the son of Njörðr,
       had seated himself on Hliðskjálf, throne of Odin, and using the throne to see into the Giant Realms, he saw and fell
        in love with a giantess, Gerðr. Freyr becomes lovesick, and Njörðr sends Skírnir, the servant of Freyr, to figure out what
        was wrong.
    </p>
    <p class="text">Freyr explains his lovesickness to Skírnir, who offers to retrieve the girl, if Freyr can provide Skírnir with a horse
       and sword to make the journey. Freyr provides Skírnir these things, and Skírnir rides off into the Land of Giants. Skírnir 
       encounters a Shepard outside of the halls of Gymir, Gerðr’s father, and is warned but Gerðr overhears Skírnir conversing 
       with the Shepard and invites him in.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        Skírnir attempts to woo Gerðr on Freyr’s behalf, offering her gold, apples that will keep her young and finally Draupnir,
        a golden ring that replicates eight times every ninth night. When she still refuses, he threatens both her and her father
        with violence. When she still refuses, Skírnir instead threatens to curse her. This finally convinces Gerðr, and she agrees
        to meet Freyr nine days later. Skírnir returns home to Freyr, who upon hearing is distraught at the concept of having to wait 
        nine more days before seeing Gerðr.
    </p>
    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <h5>Sk&iacute;rnismál and Gender Relations</h5>
    <p class="text">
        Some interpret Skírnismál as a poem about sexual violence, claiming that its interpretation as a love poem demonstrates a
        blindness to the female perspective and the actual implications of the myth’s events. Gerðr finally agrees to go to Freyr 
        after Sk&iacuternir threatens her with his sword (a phallic symbol), the wrath of the gods (the rage of patriarchal power), and a
        miserable life where she will be denied any “men to make her merry”. Freyr’s (Sk&iacuternir’s) violent victory over Gerðr, a woman,
        is his transition into manhood, as it demonstrates his participation in a patriarchal system that requires the subordination
        of the feminine. 
    </p>
    <h5>Sk&iacute;rnism&aacute;l and Ritual</h5>
    <p class="text">
        The Poem Skírnismál can be analyzed beyond just as a literary work, as it also contains a ritualistic aspect. The ritual
        attached to the poem seems mainly to be performed by children and as a form of entertainment, rather than for a specific
        religious reason. However, some do see the ritual as portraying a merge of the humanistic side of life, represented by Gerðr,
        with the divine part of life, represented by Freyr. Gerðr's rejection of the gifts offered to her and her union with Freyr
        depict a rejection of materialism for an acceptance of spirituality instead. The ritual is performed as a narration of the poem
        and is often set to music. Aligning with Frazer’s thoughts on the relationship between myths and rituals, the poem is the main
        focus of the ritual and the ritual itself is just used as an expression of the myth. 
    </p>
    <h5>Sk&iacuternir</h5>
    <p class="text">Skírnir is one of Freyr's servants in Norse Mythology, though he only appears in Skírnismál within the Poetic Edda.
       His importance to Freyr is immediate though as he plays a primary role in attaining the fertility god's love interest
       in this poem. However, his role is considered much larger as he is often considered an extension of Freyr himself. 
       This connection is drawn primarily through linguistics as 'Skírnir' has been translated to 'Shining One', 'Clear-Shining One', 
       and 'the Bright'. The root of his name, 'skína', has been referenced in other Norse literature as the shining of the sun. Freyr,
       who has been called 'skírom Frey' or 'shining Freyr', also has this solar responsibility. He has been referenced by Norwegian
       linguist Magnus Olsen as the god of sunshine and fertility due to his role in other stories. A further connection is made
       because Gerðr's name is rooted from the word 'garðr', which means 'field'. Therefore, through this connection of sun, sunlight,
       and the field that receives it, Olsen believed that "Skírnir is only another form of the god himself." This view is considered
       controversial among scholars.

    <h5>Sk&iacute;rnismál as a Hero's Tale</h5>
    <p class="text">
        Although <i>Sk&iacute;rnism&aacute;l</i> does not come off as the story of a hero, it can be seen as one when analyzed through 
        proper lens. Sk&iacute;rnir goes off to a foreign land on an adventure for Freyr. This act of going to foreign lands aligns with
        part of Joseph Campbell's description of what heroes do. Further, this story can be seen as two entities (Sk&iacute;rnir and Freyr) 
        together to accomplish one goal. When seeing what motivated Freyr to send Sk&iacute;rnir on this adventure, it is clear that this fits
        with the description Campbellian description of a hero going to marry a female god and kill a male god (Theorizing About Myth, 126).
         Although the male god is not the prominent part of this story, the goal in the end for the female god, Gerðr in this case, is
        the same. This story does not have a highly heroic component to it, but there are clearly aspects of it that offer some glimpses
        of key qualities of a heroic tale.
